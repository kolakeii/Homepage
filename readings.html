                            <p>1. The thesis of this article is that designing for the native device does not come down to any requirement of the device per se, but to the requirements of the user. The interfaces we create are abstractions, made to facilitate our interaction with the web, using metaphors that we intuitively understand to fulfill our personal needs. Ideas like the digital trash can, calendar or item interfaces are all illusions meant to represent complex and nigh incomprehensible systems of code that we never see, solely to facilitate interaction. Like the form of a map, we are given a particular view of what we want to know, while distorting all other irrelevant aspects, so that all that remains is the relevant and understandable. Alternative maps may feature different design systems to facilitate a different kind of interaction. Which is considered correct depends on the will, intuitive understanding and needs of the human user.</p>
                            <p>2. I am aesthetically more inclined towards the flat side of the web design debate. Not because I believe that screens as a 2-dimensional medium ought to erase all references to 3-dimensional reality, but merely because I find the to be a simple and clean beauty in the simple and clean flat design. However, I have more than once seen companies go down the flat design path so far that this simple beauty turned to absolute boredom, flattening their own logos for instance to remove the extra details that gave them so much personality before. In my work as an animation instructor, I often teach my student my own 3 principles of character design (Simple, Special, Smart). The design ought to be as simple as possible, leaving only the details necessary to understand the character's personality to its fullest. I believe a design is perfect, not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to remove. This threshold however, is different from one style to another, and entirely depends entirely on what information the designer believes is necessary to impart on the viewer. One ought not to go too simple, for the risk of losing all personality, but not so complex as to lose all meaning.</p>
                            <p>3. The zoopraxiscope was a device that allowed one to view a series of images strung together in quick succession, otherwise known as film. This was done by printing the images on a wheel and lighting them from behind, turning it effectively into the first screen. This was the beginning of our modern concept of digital screens of light, by which we view moving images such as film, animation, gaming, videos, gifs and websites. Another medium that has inspired digital design has been the medium of video games. In many games, the player is required to know a lot of information at once that may not be easily shown in the game space, such as the characters "health" or the amount of money the player has. Short out an actual bag in-game, designers have opted to display this information on the screen in and abstracted form, with numbers next to symbols overlaying the actual player's gameplay, known as the head's up display, or HUD. This element bleeds over into other digital mediums, such as certain necessary information overlapping written articles, battery life represented on a phone screen or other statistics that are necessary to know.</p>

                            <p>1. She posits that the website is a far more personalized and customizable representation of a person's work, more than any social media. It is independent in many ways from the rules and restraints of big social media platforms, and can be made in any format to host any kind of content. It becomes like a house that one can build to their own specifications, unlike a social media page which exists at the will of the larger media platform. I agree with this sentiment not only because the website a far superior method of personal expression of the online self, but also because, relative to the social media feeds curated for every individual user from a mountain of mostly unrelated content, the website provides a greater sense of coherency and purpose. It's finite boundaries allow the maker of the website to construct it with focus and care in a way that social media cannot.</p>
                            <p>2. A website can be understood more like a house, an assortment of different rooms designed to serve an individual core functions. The rooms each lead into one another, either connected directly or by a hallway. When designing the layout, it is best to not over complicate the design so that those who enter the house do not get lost in its maze of exits and entrances. Ensure that the house is neat and tidy, with each room being decorated and uncluttered, since this house is expecting visitors. Feel free to decorate the place. It is your house after all, and the space you live in should be a reflection of the self. Keep things fresh from time to time, changing where things are placed, spaced or hung. Change out old furniture for new, or something old and sentimental, if it looks good just as it is.</p>
